Modern Calculator
A sleek, modern, and fully responsive calculator built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project features a clean, dark-themed interface and supports both mouse/touch and keyboard inputs for a seamless user experience on any device.

‚ú® Features
All Basic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations.

Keyboard Support: Use your keyboard for a faster calculation workflow. All number and operator keys are mapped, including Enter for equals, Backspace for delete, and Escape for clearing.

Fully Responsive: The layout adapts beautifully to any screen size, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

Interactive UI: Buttons have satisfying hover and active states, and the corresponding key lights up on a keypress, providing excellent visual feedback.

Dynamic Display: The font size of the display adjusts automatically to fit longer numbers, preventing overflow issues.

Core Functions: Includes essential AC (All Clear) and DEL (Delete last digit) buttons.

Zero Dependencies: Built with pure HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS loaded via a CDN, so there's no need for a build step or package installation.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For a modern, utility-first approach to styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all the calculator logic and interactivity.

Google Fonts: For the clean 'Inter' typeface.
